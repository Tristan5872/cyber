# Learning with TryHackMe

This repository contains my notes, ressources, exercises from my learning journey on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/).

I've organized the repository into folders based on the learning paths offered by TryHackMe.<br> 
Each folder contains notes, exercises, and resources related to that specific path.
